# Trump Splash

A Minecraft resource pack that replaces the splash text in Minecraft with random Trump tweets since 2017.

For minecraft version 1.15+, but you can replace the data from pack.mcmeta so that it works with older versions.

I have no idea why anyone would want this resource pack, but whatever floats your boat, I guess.

I'm not even going to put a license on this, so go ham.
